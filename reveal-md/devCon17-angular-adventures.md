# Abstract
Get a glimpse of Angular, get going with Typescript, and learn fundamentals of components. Future proof your application by using secret weapons of Observables.

# Angular 
* Tree of interconnected web components 

# Web Components 
* higher level of visual expressivity and reusability  
* more modular
* consistent
* maintainable web

# Web Components (cont.)
* Templates: These are pieces of HTML that structure the content we aim to render  
* Custom Elements: These templates not only contain traditional HTML  
elements, but also the custom wrapper items that provide further presentation elements or API functionalities  
* Shadow DOM: This provides a sandbox to encapsulate the CSS layout rules and JavaScript behaviors of each custom element  
* HTML Imports: HTML is no longer constrained to host HTML elements, but to other HTML documents as well  

# Typescript
* Strict superset of JavaScript  
--> JavaScript programs are valid TypeScript programs 
* Adds (optional) static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language 
* Transcompiles to JavaScript 

# Components 
* A class with controls a specific view 
* Visual logic of the application 

# Component Templates
* HTML file
* CSS file
* @Component decorator has configuration object
