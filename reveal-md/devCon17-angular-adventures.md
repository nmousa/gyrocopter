# Abstract
Get a glimpse of Angular, get going with Typescript, and learn fundamentals of components. Future proof your application by using secret weapons of Observables.

# What is Angular 
* Development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications
* Tree of interconnected web components 

# Why Angular 
* <docs views> 
* <age>
* Cross platform - Ionic/Electron
* Working with Microsoft - Standardized 
* Faster rendering 
* Clearner code
* Much simpler - easier to learn

# Main Parts 
* Modules 
* Component
* Template
* Metadata
* Data Binding
* Service
* Directive
* Dependency Injection

# Components 
* A class with controls a specific view 
* Visual logic of the application 

# Web Components 
* Higher level of visual expressivity and reusability  
* More modular
* Consistent
* Maintainable web

# Web Components (cont.)
* Templates: These are pieces of HTML that structure the content we aim to render  
* Custom Elements: These templates not only contain traditional HTML  
elements, but also the custom wrapper items that provide further presentation elements or API functionalities  
* Shadow DOM: This provides a sandbox to encapsulate the CSS layout rules and JavaScript behaviors of each custom element  
* HTML Imports: HTML is no longer constrained to host HTML elements, but to other HTML documents as well  

# Component Templates
* HTML file
* CSS file
* @Component decorator has configuration object 

# Typescript
* Strict superset of JavaScript  
--> JavaScript programs are valid TypeScript programs 
* Adds (optional) static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language 
* Transcompiles to JavaScript 

# Typescript
* Prevents trivial errors
* Discovers the impact of change
* No special runtime
* Productivity booster

# Observables 
* Standard for managing async data 
* Observables open up a continuous channel of communication in which multiple values of data can be emitted over time
* New pattern for data via array-like operations to parse, modify, and maintain data

# Observables vs Promises 
* Observables can be retried
* Observables are cancellable
* Observables can define both the setup and teardown
